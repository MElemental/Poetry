#+TITLE: Change
* Sonnet 1

* Poem

others think of others as one and whole.
but is this thought even a valient goal?
the best of champions breath in and out.
why is a person's change a cause for doubt?

water flows from the river and the rain.
the blood flows through the body and the brian.
plenty others you know exhale to say.
others you know move through the normal day.

change is a part of nature and of growth.
I think it's time to end this naive oath.
I think a new call should be made to state
it is okay to cast away our fate.

we will all change, and it will never cease.
we all come in more than a single piece.
