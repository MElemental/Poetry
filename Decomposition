#+TITLE: Change
* Sonnet 1

** Poem

others think of others as one and whole.  

but is this thought even a valient goal?  

the best of champions breath in and out.  

why is a person's change a cause for doubt?  

.

water flows from the river and the rain.  

the blood flows through the body and the brian.  

plenty others you know exhale to say.  

others you know move through the normal day.  

.

change is a part of nature and of growth.  

I think it's time to end this naive oath.  

I think a new call should be made to state 

it is okay to cast away our fate.  

.

we will all change, and it will never cease.

we all come in more than a single piece.  



* Ideas
People like to assume a person whole and complete,
and it feels like there's a romantic notion to that.
But I can't accept this senseless dismissal of change,
That when things stagnate that's when a person is perfected.
for even the greatest champions breath air.
for everyone will change and that's okay.
people are not simple things and they never will be.
