#+TITLE: Decomposition
* Poem
Why do others want to assume that a person is one and whole?
Why do others want to assume that this is a valient goal?
When even the best of champions breath air in and out?
Why do people feel like a person's change should cast doubt?


* Ideas
People like to assume a person whole and complete,
and it feels like there's a romantic notion to that.
But I can't accept this senseless dismissal of change,
That when things stagnate that's when a person is perfected.
for even the greatest champions breath air.
for everyone will change and that's okay.
people are not simple things and they never will be.
Why is memento mori only a thing for those
